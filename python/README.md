# Let's understand thes models step by step

### Description
In this place you will find three enumarated folders that describe in details the main step to develop, understand, and design your machine learning model. In case that you just want to keep all your code in one file, simple and concise, then you can refer to the "just easy and simple" folder.

##### -Data Exploration

We can summarize data exploration like a combination of statistics with data visualization. The main purpose in here is to understand the nature and the relationship amoung the variables or columns in your dataset. For example, which information is influence the most in the prediction of the results? is there any reduncdant information?

##### -Data Preprocessing

In data preprocessing we try to do some data cleaning by addressing incomplete data and organizing it in such a way that it can be easier to analyze. Additionally many machine learning algorthm require us to apply data standarization or normalization to improve the results.

##### -Data Analysis

Finally in data analysis we can also talk about data modeling. This is the hardest part which include the analysis of your information through neural networks. This cover not only the design of the model but also its statistic validation and implementation.
